# Resume

My personal resume.

## Converting to PDF

To convert the LaTeX file into PDF you will need to have **Docker** and **make**
installed.

Run:

```
make
```

This will generate a lot of files, amongst which you should find a PDF file.

## Thanks

Special thanks to [Petar Šegina](https://github.com/mrPjer/) for proofreading
everything, pointing out typos and sprinkling everything with his
internship-getting voodoo.

And another round of applause for [Luka Strižić](https://github.com/lstrz) for
this fancy LaTeX template, and always helpful nods, even when they are not helpful.
